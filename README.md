# Basic Machine Learning

## Learning Snapshot
- Used Jupyter Notebook to run the python code in a way I can visualize the results much more comfortably compared to a regular terminal
- Used SkLearn Libary in Python to use Machine Learning algorithm to train the data for more accurate prediction
- Used CSV file from Programming with Mosh Youtube channel
- Thank you to the Youtube channel for taking me into the journey of learning ML
